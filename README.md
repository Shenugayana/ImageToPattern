# ImageToPattern - Star Pattern Generator

Welcome to the ImageToPattern repository! This project is a part of the IFS contest and showcases an application developed in C# that generates a star pattern resembling the provided image. With this application, you can transform an image into a creative and visually appealing star pattern.

## Overview

The ImageToPattern application is designed to convert an image into a star pattern by analyzing the image's pixels and generating a pattern that captures the essence of the original image. This creative approach adds a unique twist to image manipulation and is a great example of utilizing programming to create artistic patterns.

## Features

- **Image Processing:** The application reads an input image and processes its pixels to generate a star pattern that mimics the image's structure.

- **Star Pattern Generation:** Based on the pixel information, the application maps varying levels of brightness to different-sized star shapes, creating an artistic representation of the image.

- **Customization:** The application allows users to adjust parameters such as star size and spacing to fine-tune the resulting pattern.
